This folder contains the files that will interact with the API of CarSurvey.ph

api_request.py is the  main file. This script is done using Python 3.6.9.

The goal of this file is to demonstrate the capability of the API at https://carsurvey.ph/api/ and help the user to develop
their own script by using this file as reference.

The first thing to do is to setup the api-key in your environment variable. If you don't have an api-key, please contact
admin@carsurvey.ph and ask for an api-key.

Store your api-key in your bash file with the name CLIENT_API_KEY. A sample code is below..

export CLIENT_API_KEY='<YOUR API-KEY>'

the api_request.py will read this variable for you.

Next step is to run the api_request.py using python.

>>python api_request.py

The flow of the script is as follows:
1. API will return all of the available Maker (aka Brands)
2. The api_request.py will ask you to choose which Maker you want.
3. API will return all the models for that Maker.
4. The api_request.py willl ask you the transmission, year, and the variant.
5. The API will return the value of your chosen car model.
6. You can choose to continue and ask for another model or quit the program.

On each request, you will see the resulting URL request. you can copy past this in any browser and you should see the same
response
